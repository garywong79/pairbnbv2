<h1>Preface</h1>
<h2>In The Beginning</h2>
<p>
The Hackers Guide consists of three parts
</p>

<pre class="greenlist">
  1. Ruby Program Structure - It's main components
  2. The language processing system in general
  3. Learning the technology which reads the source code
</pre>
<p>
Ruby is a true Object Orientated Language. This document describes first the
internal construction of the Ruby Language Interpreter. It is meant to help
create a active development community. This book hopes to make the entire
Ruby Language clear for developers.
</p>
<p>
In addition to knowing the Ruby processing system, also is presented general
knowledge of Interpreter Construction, such as a scanner, and parser, and it's
techniques of appraisal. This is not an exhaustive document on language processing
of this type, but covers enough for the reader who does not know ruby fully.
</p>
<p>
A main theme of this book is this:<BR>
  <i><B> " In order to become skillful in the programming art, you should read the code of others"</b></i>
</p>
<p>
As a programmer with almost thirty years experience, I have discovered some
very neat paradims in Ruby code, that I have never seen before!
</p>
<h2>The Reader Should</h2>
</p>
<p>
First, knowledge of Ruby is not necessary. It will help of course.
</p>
<p>
Second. 'C' Language knowledge is necessary!
</p>
<p>
A foundation in Object Orientated Languages (Java/C++) will also be helpful.
</p>
<p>
